# RAB_RTS_2
## Here is my first big C++ project. 

RTS here means "Road to Space", besides it is turn-based strategy (remake of my old project).
RAB stands for "Red and Blue" - my series of games.

#### Project's goal is me to study C++ and game development. 
So here I've made:
<ul>
  <li>Dijkstra shortest path algorithm</li>
  <li>Fog of war (with various visible area for different kind of objects)</li>
  <li>It takes several turns to build something</li>
  <li>Units can do their tasks on their own after you finish your turn</li>
  <li>Hotseat for two players</li>
</ul>

#### Graphics and some other stuff use SDL and its libraries. Here I also used FreeMono font.
#### Textures are my own samples, so I'm going to replace it someday.

#### To build the project I used Visual Studio 2019. 
#### Additional dependencies are SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf.
